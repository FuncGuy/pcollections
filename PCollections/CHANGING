***Updating JavaDoc***
If you re-generate the documentation, only commit it if you are sure that the MIME Types are set correctly.
This is done by enabling SVN Auto-Properties, by editing your ~/.subversion/config file, such that it contains
the following lines:

enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.txt = svn:mime-type=text/plain
*.html = svn:mime-type=text/html
*.css = svn:mime-type=text/css
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.svg = svn:mime-type=image/svg+xml
*.gif = svn:mime-type=image/gif

This is important because the website links to Javadoc within the SVN repository, and the links will all look
like text (as opposed to rendered HTML) if the mime types are wrong.

***Updating Version***
This project uses Semantic Versioning. See src/VERSION.
