***Updating JavaDoc***
If you re-generate the documentation, only commit it if you are sure that the MIME Types are set correctly.
This is done by enabling SVN Auto-Properties, by editing your ~/.subversion/config file, such that it contains the following lines:

enable-auto-props = yes
[auto-props]
*.txt = svn:mime-type=text/plain
*.html = svn:mime-type=text/html
*.css = svn:mime-type=text/css
*.png = svn:mime-type=image/png
*.jpg = svn:mime-type=image/jpeg
*.svg = svn:mime-type=image/svg+xml
*.gif = svn:mime-type=image/gif

This is important because the website links to Javadoc within the SVN repository, and the links will all look like text (as opposed to rendered HTML) if the mime types are wrong.

***Releasing a New Version***
This project uses Semantic Versioning. See src/VERSION.

To build and commit the new artifacts: // TODO improve this...
First, update the version number in pom.xml, then:
svn ci # commit the update to trunk
mvn source:jar javadoc:jar verify repository:bundle-create
svn add target/apidocs target/*.jar target/*.jar.asc
svn cp -m "vX.Y.Z" . https://pcollections.googlecode.com/svn/tags/vX.Y.Z/ # commit the tag
Update links on the google code page, and upload the jars to the downloads section, then:
mvn clean
svn revert target # avoid committing artifacts to trunk

For uploading to the Maven repo, see:
http://nexus.sonatype.org/oss-repository-hosting.html
